Write a command that finds all empty files and directories in the current directory and all sub-directories. Only the names of the files and directories should be displayed (not the entire path), hidden files should be listed, one file name per line, the listing should end with a new line, you are not allowed to use basename, grep, egrep, fgrep or rgrep.
